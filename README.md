# Binary_Flow üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Binary_Solutions


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Adithya S - College of Engineering Adoor
- Member 2: Basil Ali - College of Engineering Adoor

### Project Description
Given any images of an object, the program "calculates" how long it would take for a human to read aloud its binary code.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
No traditional way to know how long it take for a human to read the binary code of an image.
People have been somehow living without this knowledge, but we decided this gap in human understanding must be closed.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An application that enables anyone to know how long it would take for a human to read aloud binary code of an image.
It‚Äôs scientifically useless, but spiritually satisfying.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: Dart(Flutter)
- Frameworks used: Flutter SDK
- Libraries used:
	file_picker (to pick your totally random image)
	Dart io & typed_data (to get the file size in bytes)
- Tools:
	Visual Studio Code
	Android SDK
	Physical Android Device (because emulators are too mainstream)


### Implementation

For Software:
# Installation
# Navigate to where you want the project
	cd ~/Documents

# Create the Flutter project
	flutter create binary_flow
	cd binary_flow

# Add file picker dependency
	flutter pub add file_picker


# Run
	flutter run

### Project Demo


Workflow:

	Pick any image file.
	Convert to bytes ‚Üí convert bytes to bits.
	Divide by 2 bits/sec to get reading time.
	Print result and feel smarter for no reason.

## Team Contributions
- Adithya S: Main Flutter app developer, binary time calculation logic.
- Basil Ali: UI design, comic relief, and file picker integration.
